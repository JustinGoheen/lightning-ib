## Overview

Lightning Pod is a template Python environment, tooling, and system architecture for artificial intelligence and machine learning projects. The project culminates with an [app](https://01gcfpsrmb3cb4x9bc6sqvhazs.litng-ai-03.litng.ai/view/home) deployed to the Lightning Cloud platform.

### Core Code

`lightning_pod.core` contains code for LightningModule and and the Trainer.

`lightning_pod.pipeline` contains code for data preprocessing, building a Torch Dataset, and LightningDataModule.

If you only need to process data and implement an algorithm from a paper or pseudcode, you can focus on `lightning_pod.core` and `lightning_pod.pipeline` and ignore the rest of the code, so long as you follow the basic class and function naming conventions I've provided.

> Altering the naming conventions will cause the flow to break. Be sure to refactor correctly.

### Using the Template

The intent is that users [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repo, set that fork as a [template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository), then [create a new repo from their template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), and lastly [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) their newly created repo created from the template.

> it is recommended to keep your fork of lightning-pod free of changes and synced with the lightning-pod source repo, as this ensures new features become available immediately after release

#### Creating an Environment

Base dependencies can be viewed in [setup.cfg](https://github.com/JustinGoheen/lightning-pod/blob/main/pyproject.toml).

Instructions for creating a new environment are shown below.

<details>
  <summary>poetry</summary>

Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installing-with-the-official-installer) if you do not already have it installed.

```sh
cd {{ path to clone }}
poetry install
# if desired, install extras
poetry shell
pip install -r requirements/extras.txt
{{ set interpreter in IDE }}
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>conda</summary>

Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) if you do not already have it installed.

> m-series macOS users, it is recommended to use the `Miniconda3 macOS Apple M1 64-bit bash` installation

```sh
cd {{ path to clone }}
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate lightning-ai
pip install -e .
# if desired, install extras
pip install -r requirements/extras.txt
{{ set interpreter in IDE }}
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>venv</summary>

[venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is not something that needs to be installed; it is part of Python standard.

```sh
cd {{ path to clone }}
python3 -m venv venv/
# to activate on windows
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# to activate on macos and Unix
source venv/bin/activate
# install lightning-pod
pip install -e .
# if desired, install extras
pip install -r requirements/extras.txt
{{ set interpreter in IDE }}
```
</details>

#### Command Line Interface

A [CLI](https://github.com/JustinGoheen/lightning-pod/blob/main/lightning_pod/cli/console.py) `pod` is provided to assist with certain project tasks and to interact with Trainer. The commands for `pod` and their affects are shown below.

<details>
  <summary>pod</summary>

`pod teardown` will destroy any existing data splits, saved predictions, logs, profilers, checkpoints, and ONNX. <br>

`pod trainer run` runs the Trainer. <br>

`pod bug-report` creates a bug report to [submit issues on GitHub](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning/issues) for Lightning. the report is printed to screen in terminal, and generated as a markdown file for easy submission.

`pod seed` will remove boilerplate to allow users to begin their own projects.

Files removed by `pod seed`:

- cached MNIST data found in `data/cache/LitDataSet`
- training splits found in `data/training_split`
- saved predictions found in `data/predictions`
- PyTorch Profiler logs found in `logs/profiler`
- TensorBoard logs found in `logs/logger`
- model checkpoints found in `models/checkpoints`
- persisted ONNX model found in `models/onnx`

The flow for creating new checkpoints and an ONNX model from the provided encoder-decoder looks like:

```sh
pod teardown
pod trainer run
```

Once the new Trainer has finished, the app can be viewed by running the following in terminal:

```sh
lightning run app app.py
```

## Deep Learning

Grant Sanderson, also known as 3blue1brown on YouTube, has provided a very useful, high level [introduction to neural networks](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks). Grant's [other videos](https://www.3blue1brown.com/#lessons) are also useful for computer and data science, and mathematics in general.

NYU's Alfredo Canziani has created a [YouTube Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLHTzKZzVU9e6xUfG10TkTWApKSZCzuBI) for his lectures on deep learning. Additionally, Professor Canziani was kind enough to make his course materials public [on GitHub](https://github.com/Atcold/NYU-DLSP21).

The book [Dive into Deep Learning](http://d2l.ai/#), created by a team of Amazon engineers, is availlable for free.

DeepMind has shared several lectures series created for UCL [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/DeepMind/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=9).

OpenAI has created [Spinning Up in Deep RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/), an introductory series in reinforcement learning and deep learning.

## Cloud Development

Lightning Pod enables development with GitHub CodeSpaces. Please note that lightning-pod has only been tested with regard to creating and training a custom LightningModule i.e. it is necessary to debug Lightning and Dash apps locally.

<div align="center">

[![Open in Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new?repo=JustinGoheen/lightning-pod)

</div>

CodeSpaces use pyenv. User do not need to create an environment, as it will be created for them on launch.

Once the workspace image has finished building, do the following to teardown the example and run a trainer of your own from the provided example LightningModule:

```sh
pip3 install -e .
pod teardown
pod trainer run
```
